# Codehort-Year-Coding-Challenge 2024


Welcome to my submissions for the Centennial College Coding Club 'Codehort's submissions for their Year-long coding challenge.

I wanted to expand my previous skills and hopefully learn some new ones as I incrementally work towards building my portfolio.

While some of solutions could be optimized in regards to using a lower/higher level programming language, I hope readers will observe and appreciate my approach to problem-solving.
